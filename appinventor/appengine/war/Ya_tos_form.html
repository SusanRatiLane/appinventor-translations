                    <p>We may log the IP address, operating
                      system and browser software used by each user of the Site, and we may be able

                      <li>For purposes of scientific research, particularly, for example, in the areas
                        of how people learn and create with MIT App Inventor.
                      </li>
                      <li>For the purpose for which you specifically provided the personal information,
                        for example to respond to a specific inquiry or provide you the specific
                        course and/or services you select.
                      </li>
                      <li>To publish information gathered about learning
                        and creating with MIT App Inventor but only as non-personally
                        identifiable data.
                      </li>
                      <li>As otherwise described to you at the point of collection.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Sharing with Third Parties</h4>

                    We may share the information we collect with third parties as follows:

                    <ul type=disc>
                      <li>With service providers or contractors  that perform certain functions on our
                        behalf, including processing information that you provide to us on the
                        Site or operating the Site or portions of it.
                        These service providers and
                        contractors will be obligated to keep your information confidential.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        With research collaborators, but only under the condition that they are obligated to
                        keep any personally identifying information confidential.
                      </li>
                      <li>To respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, in response to
                        a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another government
                        agency, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
                        activities, suspected fraud, or to enforce our user agreement or privacy
                        policy, or to protect our rights or the rights of others.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Apps you create</h4>

                    <p>By creating and storing apps on the MIT App Inventor server
                      you represent and warrant that you are the owner
                      and creator of the apps, (i) that you have the authority to authorize MIT to
                      store the apps on the MIT App Inventor Server and (ii) you will use the apps in
                      compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You, and not MIT, are
                      solely responsible for your apps and your use of them.</p>

                    <p>MIT has no proprietary rights in the apps you create with MIT App
                      Inventor.  These apps belong to you.  Your apps are stored on the MIT
                      App Inventor server.  You have the right to download your apps and
                      delete them from the server at any time.  If you delete an app, there is the
                      possibility that MIT may be able to continue to access it from the backups we
                      keep for purposes of system maintenance, but these backups are periodically
                      purged and are not designed for long-term preservation.
                      We therefore suggest that you
                      maintain backup copies of valuable apps at places besides the MIT App
                      Inventor server. MIT will strive to keep your apps and your account
                      accessible to you for as long as you wish, but we have no obligation
                      to do so, and MIT has no liability for the consequences of the service
                      becoming unavailable or your apps becoming unavailable.</p>

                    <h4>Use of MIT Names and Trademarks</h4>

                    <p>"MIT App Inventor", "MIT",
                      "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", and its logos and seal are

                      MIT. You may not use the MIT name in any of its forms nor MIT seals or logos
                      for promotional purposes, or in any way that deliberately or inadvertently
                      claims, suggests, or in MIT's sole judgment gives the appearance or impression
                      of a relationship with or endorsement by MIT.</p>
